A starter Go/Web application framework in the style of [hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter). Started in response to [this reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/4twe9q/hackathonstarter_alternative_in_golang/).

See the [wiki](https://github.com/gomatic/opinionated/wiki) for design ideas and goals.
